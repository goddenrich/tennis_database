Paragraph:
The database will be storing information for tennis tournaments, in the point 
of view of a tournament organiser/data provider. There will be six entities:
Tournament, Players, Matches, Stadiums/Courts, Spectators and Tickets.
The organisation aspect will involve court numbers/tickets and spectators,
whilst data provided will be relevant to player and match stats.
We will be chosing the Web Front-End Option for Part 3. Users will be able to
query this database to discover player stats and match outcomes (E.g. who won
which match, what those match statistics were, what the player statistics in
the tournament were, what their overall statistics are, etc..). As well as
looking at logistics, enquiries about where the matches are taking place,
ticket prices, and spectator statistics.
Challenges will involve the large number of features we will have to include in
this database, as well as looking at the relationships between the entity sets.
Some are not so obvious, particularly with the tickets (can be different types),
not necessarily one to one relationships (1 ticket may not be to 1 match).




We will fill all the player and match data with real data from Jeff Sackmann
tennis_atp github. The spectator and ticket details may require further research
/fill in fake data.




E-R diagram: To do


Contingency plan: Deal only with the players/matches/tournaments and maybe
courts, as the data is already there in csv's.
