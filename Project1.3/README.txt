4. The two web pages that require the most interesting database operations are:
        
     a. 104.155.226.83:8111/tournaments.html
        This page reports statistics of a user inputed tennis tournament. The user can enter the name of the tournament they wish to see. The page then displays a bargraph of the tickets numbers for each match that was or is sheduled to be played in that tournament as well as a pie chart of the split of the gender of the audience. The query for the ticket sales bar graph is particularly interesting because it links most tables in the database to find out the names of the two players in the match to give a more informative match name than the match id.
